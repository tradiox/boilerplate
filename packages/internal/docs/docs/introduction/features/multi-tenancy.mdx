The multitenancy feature in <ProjectName/> enables users to create and manage multiple tenants within their account.
Each tenant operates autonomously, with its own settings, members, and resources.

### Default Tenant

Upon account creation, users are provided with a default tenant. This serves as the primary unit for their activities,
enabling immediate engagement without additional setup.

### Tenant Creation

Users can create additional tenants as needed, allowing them to manage multiple projects or entities within the same
account.

### Membership Roles

The multitenancy feature introduces three distinct roles for members within each tenant:

- **Owner**: Owners have full control and authority over the tenant. They can manage settings, invite new members,
assign roles, and oversee tenant activities.
- **Admin**: Admins assist owners in managing the tenant. They possess similar privileges to owners but may have
limitations on certain administrative actions.
- **Member**: Members are regular users within the tenant, contributing to projects and collaborating with teammates.

:::note
These roles are set up by default in the <ProjectName/>. Developers can customize these roles or add their own
configuration to suit the specific needs of their application.

### Invitation System

Owners can invite new members to join their tenant, controlling access and ensuring secure collaboration. Invited
members receive notifications and can accept or decline invitations.
