<ProjectName/> provides a payments and subscriptions functionality seamlessly integrated with Stripe.
This feature empowers tenants to handle financial transactions and manage subscription plans directly within the application.
This functionality is divided into two parts:

- **[payments](#payments)**
- **[subscription management](#subscription-management)**


### Payments

The payments functionality allows tenant owners to define payment methods (including multiple cards) that are stored in the
Stripe merchant account. Tenant owners can edit and update their payment methods at any time.

</p>

Tenants can initiate transactions using the payment form, specifying the amount in USD and selecting a stored payment
method or adding a new card for one-time charges. Successful transactions are recorded in the transaction history for reference.

</p>

### Subscription management

The subscription management functionality allows tenant owners to select one of the three pre-defined plans in the Stripe admin
panel: Free, Monthly, and Yearly. The selected plan is automatically registered as an active subscription in the system
and can be used in the business logic of the application. The system supports changing and canceling subscriptions
based on the rules defined by the application administrator in Stripe.

Having Stripe payments integrated from the start of a SaaS project offers several advantages. First, it allows for a
seamless user experience, as tenants can easily subscribe to paid plans and make payments without leaving the application.
Second, it allows for better financial tracking and reporting, as all payment information is stored in the Stripe
merchant account. Finally, it provides a scalable payment solution that can grow with the application, as Stripe
supports a wide range of payment methods and currencies.

_Payments and subscriptions functionality is a critical component of any SaaS application. SaaS Boilerplate offers a
robust payments and subscriptions solution out of the box, integrated with Stripe. This functionality includes payment
method management, a payment form for transactions, active subscription management, and the ability to change and cancel
subscriptions._
