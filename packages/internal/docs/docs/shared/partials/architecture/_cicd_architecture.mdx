## CI/CD architecture diagram

SaaS Boilerplate comes with a preconfigured Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline
implemented with AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline for each deployed environment.

The deployment pipeline is configured to start automatically after each code push to a specific set of branches to the
CodeCommit repository created by the CI/CD CDK stack. Each environment can have a different branch configuration.
