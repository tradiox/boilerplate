### Monitoring

To monitor the Celery cluster you can use **Flower**, which is configured in <ProjectName /> by default.
Flower is an open-source web application for monitoring and managing Celery clusters. It provides real-time information
about the status of Celery workers and tasks.

If you want to learn more about flower configuration visit
[official documentation](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

#### Localhost

To access Flower on localhost open [http://localhost:5555/](http://localhost:5555/) in your browser.

#### After deployment

To access Flower in deployed environment open `http://flower.<your-stage-domain>` in your browser.

### Browsing task results

By default, in <ProjectName />, `django-db` is configured as a Celery result backend. It means all tasks' results are
serialized to PostgreSQL database and you are able to browse through those results in Django Admin.

#### Localhost

To access the list open [http://admin.localhost:5001/django_celery_results/taskresult/](http://admin.localhost:5001/django_celery_results/taskresult/)
in your browser.

#### After deployment

To access the list in deployed environment open `https://flower.<your-stage-domain>/django_celery_results/taskresult/`
in your browser.
