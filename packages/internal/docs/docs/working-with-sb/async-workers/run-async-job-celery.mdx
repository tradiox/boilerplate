#### Invoking tasks

Running Celery asynchronous tasks from the backend is pretty straightforward and it's best that you refer to the
official docs, but here's a very basic example:

```python showLineNumbers
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task()
def example_task(arg1: str, arg2: dict):
    pass
```

```python showLineNumbers
example_task.apply_async(('arg1-value', { 'arg2-field': 'arg2-field-value' }))
```
